- Porter Mecham - Hi I'm majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I'm married, and spend all of my free time with my amazing wife. I like programming reading self-help books and playing videogames.

- Hi I'm Weston! I'm a third semester student at BYU Idaho, and this is my second semester on campus. I love tanks, and if I start talking about them I find it hard to stop :) Did you know that Ferdinand Porsche constructed fifty chassis for his heavy tank before the German military had the chance to reject it? I'm a data science major, minoring in CIT.
